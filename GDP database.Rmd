GDP dataset.

The dataset includes:

Overall GDP indicators (T10101 - T10111)
Breakdown by product type (T10201 - T10206)
Breakdown by sector (T10301 - T10306)
Price indexes & inflation indicators (T10404, T10604, etc.)
National income and corporate data (T11000 - T11600)



Time Series Analysis (GDP Over Time)
Track GDP trends using "T10105" (Gross Domestic Product).
Compare annual vs. quarterly GDP (T10105-A vs. T10105-Q).
Calculate growth rates (T10101 - Percent Change in GDP).


library(ggplot2)
gdp_annual <- gdp_data_list[["T10105-A"]]
colnames(gdp_annual) <- make.names(colnames(gdp_annual))
gdp_annual <- gdp_annual %>% rename(Date = 1, GDP = 2)

ggplot(gdp_annual, aes(x = Date, y = GDP)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Annual GDP Trends", x = "Year", y = "GDP (Billions)")


Sector Contribution to GDP
Identify the fastest-growing sectors using "T10305" (Gross Value Added by Sector).
Compare GDP share by sector over time.

sector_gdp <- gdp_data_list[["T10305-A"]]
ggplot(sector_gdp, aes(x = Date, y = Manufacturing)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Manufacturing Sector GDP Contribution", x = "Year", y = "GDP (Billions)")


Inflation & Price Indexes
Use "T10104" (Price Indexes for GDP) and "T10604" (Price Indexes for Purchases).
Compare real vs. nominal GDP using "T10106" (Chained Dollars).

price_index <- gdp_data_list[["T10104-A"]]
ggplot(price_index, aes(x = Date, y = PriceIndex)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "GDP Price Index Over Time", x = "Year", y = "Index Value")


Recession Analysis
Look for negative GDP growth in "T10101" (Percent Change in GDP).
Identify declining economic activity using "T10405" (Relation of GDP to Purchases).

gdp_growth <- gdp_data_list[["T10101-A"]]
gdp_growth <- gdp_growth %>% mutate(Recession = ifelse(GrowthRate < 0, "Recession", "Growth"))

ggplot(gdp_growth, aes(x = Date, y = GrowthRate, color = Recession)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "GDP Growth Rate and Recession Periods", x = "Year", y = "Growth Rate (%)")


Predicting Future GDP
Apply time series forecasting (auto.arima()) on "T10105".

library(forecast)
gdp_ts <- ts(gdp_annual$GDP, start = min(gdp_annual$Date), frequency = 1)
model <- auto.arima(gdp_ts)
forecasted_gdp <- forecast(model, h = 5)
autoplot(forecasted_gdp)
